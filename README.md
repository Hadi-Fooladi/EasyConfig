# Purpose
From my experience point of view any application needs to have a configuration file (or any type of media) to adjust its behaviour. So in any application you need to write a piece of code to deal with reading this configuration file. At first this is interesting but after a while it becomes cumbersome because you need to write these code in every project you are working with. Also making changes to the structure of the config file would require change to the code which requires time and it's not bug free operation.

In this project (tool) the structure of config files can be described in an XML-like textual document. And based on this descriptor file a class will be generated by this tool to read the actual config file. Also there is an editor application to create a config/change a new/existing config file based on a descriptor file.
